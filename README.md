# os_project
An attempt at a microkernel, but honestly, it will probably fail seeing as I just got started lol.

## TODO

- [ ] Sleep function that doesn't rely on RTC (RDTSC/HPET)

## In progress
- [ ] Ring 3 tasks

## Recently completed
- [x] Pre-emptive multitasking (thanks Phil Opp) [STILL NEEDS WORK]
