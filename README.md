# os_project
An attempt at a microkernel, but honestly, it will probably fail seeing as I just got started lol.

## TODO
- [ ] Use the RDTSC reading to provide a way of more accurate sleep?
- [ ] Check if LAPIC is always mapped to the same memory location.
- [ ] Sleep function that doesn't rely on RTC.

## In progress
- [ ] Pre-emptive multitasking (thanks Phil Opp)

## Recently completed
- [x] HPET implementation
- [x] IOAPIC implementation (again)

## Long term goals
- [ ] Userspace
- [ ] Some sort of GUI
